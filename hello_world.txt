Hello frens, 
my name is majestyurl and today I am taking action on my github journey. 
I am refreshing myself on Oden Projects fullstack course. 
In the past, i got up to the html and css section before giving up
so this time i am pushing myself to go harder, farther, and for longer. 
My true goal is to at least get decent at Javascript and Python so i can add basic functionality 
to most websites.
