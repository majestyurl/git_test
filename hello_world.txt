Hello frens, 
my name is majestyurl and today I am taking action on my github journey. 
I am refreshing myself on Oden Projects fullstack course. 
In the past, i got up to the html and css section before giving up
so this time i am pushing myself to go harder, farther, and for longer. 
My true goal is to at least get decent at Javascript and Python so i can add basic functionality 
to most websites. 

So far, this is the list of tools I have:
open terminal 
cmd + shift + p in vs code to install "code" shortcut

cd - change directory
ls - list (contents of directory)
mkdir - make directory
touch - create file 
git add - adds files to staging area in git
git commit -m ">insert message< (whatever we add)" - commits previously added argument w/ message 
git push - push to github repo
git push origin main - push to github when dealing with multiple branches
